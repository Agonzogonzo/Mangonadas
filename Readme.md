# Policing Proximate to Hazards
By Danielle Hoague & Andres Gonzalez
-----

## Introduction
- Contamination from heavy metals and other toxic pollutants continues from the legacies of redlining, segregation, and discriminatory land use practices by localizing hazardous materials in Black, Indigenous, Latin, Asian and Pacific Islander communities.
- Proximity to these toxic materials can have long lasting neurological impacts and can stunt childhood development (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000353). Oftentimes, the mental and psychological issues that arise from exposure to toxic materials can result in socio-behavioral issues that are interpreted by law enforcement and other community members as a threat or violent behavior. This phenomenon could be even more commonplace in communities that are already over-policed; where minor instigations can result in excessive violence and suppression by law enforcement officers.


### *Our research seeks to understand: Are communities that are proximate to environmental health hazards more policed than those not as exposed by environmental health hazards?* 

## Explanation
- Exposure to pollution can cause a plethora of negative health outcomes including degraded mental and physical health . Mental health conditions can manifest from unremediated exposure to ambient air pollution containing a mix of compounds including particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) [NCBI, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5891065/#:~:text=A%20growing%20body%20of%20evidence,to%20air%20pollutants%20%5B2%5D.). According to the Journal of Urban Design and Mental Health, there is a paucity of evidence that mental health is correlated with ambient air pollution because there are confounding factors such as urban access to green space, vegetation, density and high rise living [King, 2018](https://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com/journal-4---air-pollution-and-mental-health.html).
- Behaviors associated with mental health conditions could be criminalized or deemed as “deviant”. Due to the perceptions of mental health concerns by law enforcement and communities, those who have been exposed by environmental hazards could be perceived as a threat to public safety. 

## Spatial scope
- Using 2019 Geohub Los Angeles data, we will examine if pollution correlates with excessive policing in the city of Los Angeles. We will overlay crime incident data with environmental hazard data by census tract in Los Angeles, putting an emphasis on the packed hazardous facility corridor in the southeast region of the city.
- We anticipate that our main challenge will be providing statistically significant data overlaying these two features of vulnerable communities of color, many who are already overpoliced. 

 

## Data Description
- We will be using real-time 2019 data from GeoHub LA. 
- Our crime incident data is transcribed from LAPD paper reports. There are 21 community police stations defining the geographic areas of their communities. The address fields are defined to the nearest hundred block to protect the privacy of the people involved in the incidents.
- The Geohub Environmental Justice Screening Method data is sourced from the California Office of Health Hazard Assessment. The data is defined by the cumulative impacts of social and health vulnerability, health risk and risk exposure, climate change vulnerability, and hazard proximity and sensitive land uses.

## Scope
- We hope to understand what kind of policing occurs and compare different crimes to a census tract’s proximity to environmental hazards. By using the Geohub data, we will also be able to further visualize this distribution by race and income.
-Further visualizations could include overlaying hazardous facility sites, as well as compare a community's vulnerability to climate change, health, and cumulative pollution impacts to local policing.

## Conclusion:
- We anticipate finding that particularly in Black and Brown communities there could be elevated levels policing compared to the average in Los Angeles. Our main objective is to see if crime incident data rates variate based on areas experiencing greater amounts of vulnerability due to environmental health hazards. 
- We hypothesize that there could be a significantly greater level of policing in these areas than the average of Los Angeles and of neighboring census tracts. Furthermore, we predict that crimes reported connected to mental health issues will be significantly greater in census tracts closer to proximity to pollution. 
- We hope to visulaize these connections between policing and environmental hazards because these factors are crucial to understanding which landscapes are at a higher risk of being exposed to police brutality.
