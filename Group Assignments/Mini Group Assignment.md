# **Mini Group Assignment Week 4 Andres and Dani**

# **Project Title**: Environmental and Policing Hazards
[*Proposal*](https://github.com/Agonzogonzo/Mangonadas#by-danielle-hoague--andres-gonzalez)

# **Roles** 
**Andres** Co-Executive Coder 
		-Responsible for querying the data and creating subsets of
		-Merging data
		-Querying and subsetting large data sets
	Danielle Hoague- Co-Executive Coder
		-Data manipulation
-Responsible for creating maps
		- Submitting assignments
**Status Update:** 
General mood is no mistakes, except for when we Miss Steaks! We’re doing good besides the potential coup. Our workflow in switching between notebooks is working well; 
We learn a lot by following each other’s steps in our shared notebooks with every switch. 

For our analysis, we are considering mapping three types of crime incidents. We could see a correlation between different types of policing in areas most affected by environmental hazards. Our three types of incidents will include: suicide attempts, public disturbances, and homicides. 

Data Update: 
We’ve been able to work and merge our Census Tract and Environmental Justice data but still need to understand some elements of our analysis (such as the histograms that are put out). Our main concern at this point in time though is the lack of a clear indicator that can be connected to over policing in environmental hazard areas, relative to over policing in neighboring areas. For example: how do we know that over policing in a neighborhood with an env hazard is because of the hazards impacts and not over policing in the entire area?

Sources: 
EJSM scores
2012 Census tract data for geometry 
LA City crime incident data
	Arrest? Incident? (arrest by potential type: suicide attempts, public disturbance)


Concerns: 
Major Concerns:
Potential Coup attempts 
Querying and subsetting large policing data set 
Finding a variable that can connect the social and policing impacts of environmental contamination
Integrating our two datasets into one map so that we can identify a correlation

Minor Concerns:
Running analyses in Juypter Notebook that surpass the notebooks capacity
Creating a false positive when running a statistical analysis testing the statistical significance of policing in environmentally hazardous areas

**Status Update:** 
General mood: No mistakes, except for when we make [Big Miss Steaks](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.280316045.1561/flat,800x800,075,f.jpg)! We’re doing well other than the imminent threat of a potential coup and civil uprising following the election. 
Our workflow in swapping our work between notebooks is working well. We learn a lot by following each other’s steps in our shared notebooks with every switch. 

**Data Update:**
For our analysis, we are considering mapping three types of crime incidents. Our three types of incidents will include: suicide attempts, public disturbances, and homicides. We could see a correlation between different types of policing in areas most affected by environmental hazards in south central Los Angeles. 
Through trial and error, we have been able to work and merge our Census Tract and Environmental Justice data, but still need to understand some elements of our analysis. The elements we need to work on include manipulating the homogeneous scores numbered 1-5 in the EJSM data. 
Our main concern at this point in time is the lack of a clear indicator that can be connected to over policing in environmental hazard areas. This is relative to over-policing in neighboring areas because there are so many confounding variables. For example: How do we know that over policing in a neighborhood with an environmental hazard is a result of the hazardous impacts and instead of over policing in the general vicinity?
