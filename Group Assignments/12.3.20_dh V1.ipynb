Looking back now, we would like to have examined a larger sample, but based on our gigabyte limit on Jupyter Hub, we were unsure how far to push this. From this bar graph, it becomes clear that aggravated assault, driving under the influence, and other crimes are the largest ones. Weâ€™re trying to focus on aggravated assault, disturbing the peace, and disorderly contact, because these are the ones we believe can connect policing to proximity to hazards (the ejsm score). Itâ€™s clear that aggravated assault is the largest sample; there are significantly less for disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace.
