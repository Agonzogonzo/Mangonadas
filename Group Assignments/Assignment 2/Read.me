### Policing and Environment Group Assignment Two-  :caterpillar:
To start our data analysis, we merged our environmental justice scores data frame with the LA census data for 2012 data frame with the object "FIPS". 

By adding a leading zero to our EJSM data, we were able to merge census variables (geometry). Our maps tell a story about which areas in Los Angeles are most affected by environmental hazards. We the cumulative impact score includes the variables of climate change vulnerability, environmental hazards, social vulnerability, and health scores. By using the cumulative impact score for our main variable of analysis, we were able to get a glimpse of what further incorporation of each of these variables might entail.
